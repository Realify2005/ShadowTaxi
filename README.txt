#619 in EDSTEM, I have already implemented alternative logic in which the passenger priority is still dynamic even if
it is already in the taxi and being dropped off. It only stays after it is dropped off to the sideway, trip is done,
and earnings calculated etc. (This is the alternative logic that tutor Charlie Ding mentioned in a reply to few threads
so I have implemented that instead).

#698 in EDSTEM, demo shows that if car collides with taxi that's invincible it does not break, when it reality according
to the specs the car should break since taxi still deals 100 damage regardless.
